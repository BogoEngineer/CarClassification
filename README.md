A small ML project that uses supervised algorithm(KNN) to determine given car's value by taking some of it's features into the account. This is a multiclassification problem(car may be classified as unacceptable, acceptable, good or very good). 
Coding was done in Python(3.7), and the libraries/tools used were: scikit-learn, pandas, pickle and numpy.
The resulting accuracy fluctuates around 96%.
